# Angular Cards Holographic effect

This project is inspired by the work of [simeydotme](https://github.com/simeydotme/pokemon-cards-css).

It is an Angular library that exports a `CardComponent`, which can be used to display any image and apply the famous [Holo cards effects]([https://poke-holo.simey.me/](https://poke-holo.simey.me/)) on it.

It uses the original CSS files by simeydotme, but with some variations. Some mechanics have been rewritten so that it doesn't rely on Svelte. In fact, it has no dependencies apart from Angular.

> [!WARNING]
>  
> This project is still a Work in Progress. Not all effects have been implemented yet, and most of those that are available don't look exactly like the original ones. Also, the library is not optimized for mobile, nor for performance in general.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Usage

For the library instructions, see the library [README](projects/ngx-holo-cards-effect/README.md).

The showcase page allows to preview the library in action, and also to test the component parameters.

No card is shipped with the Showcase, but a list of cards can be imported using the _Import JSON_ button.
