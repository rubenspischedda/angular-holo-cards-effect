# NgxHoloCardsEffect

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.0.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This project is still a Work in Progress. Not all effects have been implemented yet, and most of those that are available don't look exactly like the original ones. Also, the library is not optimized for mobile, nor for performance in general.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project ngx-holo-cards-effect` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project ngx-holo-cards-effect`.

> Note: Don't forget to add `--project ngx-holo-cards-effect` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Build

Run `ng build ngx-holo-cards-effect` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build ngx-holo-cards-effect`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/ngx-holo-cards-effect` and run `npm publish`.
